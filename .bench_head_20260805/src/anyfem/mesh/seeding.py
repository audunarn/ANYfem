"""Edge seeding: how many elements each line is divided into.

Under mapped meshing this is the piece with no fallback, so it gets solved
explicitly rather than guessed at.

Every edge carries a division count ``n``.  A mapped face requires its
opposite sides to agree::

    sum(n over side 0) == sum(n over side 2)
    sum(n over side 1) == sum(n over side 3)

A shared edge has exactly one ``n``, which is where persistent topology pays
off: conformity between neighbouring faces becomes automatic rather than a
coincident-node tolerance problem.  But the constraints **propagate across the
whole assembly** -- seeding one edge forces its opposite, which forces the
neighbouring face's edge across the shared boundary, and so on.

The solve is:

1. derive a desired ``n`` per edge by integrating the size field along it --
   just ``length / target`` when the field is uniform -- or take an explicit
   override;
2. union-find the forced equalities -- opposite sides that are both a single
   edge must have equal ``n`` -- into equivalence classes holding one ``n``;
3. bounded iterative repair for multi-edge chains: raise the coarser side to
   match the finer, refining the coarsest edges first;
4. re-verify, and report any unresolvable configuration by naming the face.

Repair only ever refines, so the process is monotone.  Pathological cyclic
topologies are caught by a sweep cap rather than looping forever.
