"""Local mesh refinement: a size field over the model.

Uniform meshing forces one compromise everywhere -- fine enough for the stress
concentration means fine everywhere, which is what makes a model too big to
solve.  A refinement zone says "this small, here", and the element size grows
back to the global target with distance.

The zone is a *distance to a set of source points*.  Which points those are
comes from what the zone is bound to: a modelled point contributes itself, a
line contributes samples along it, a plate contributes samples over its
surface.  One distance function then serves point, line and patch refinement
rather than three special cases, and the sampling density is tied to the zone's
own size so the discretisation of the source is always finer than the mesh it
controls.

Outside the radius the size grows geometrically::

    size(d) = zone.size * growth ** ((d - radius) / zone.size)

capped at the global target.  ``growth`` is therefore the ratio between
neighbouring element sizes in the transition -- 1.0 would never return to the
target, so it is refused.

Like every other attribute, a zone binds to a topology entity and is resolved
at mesh time, so re-meshing or editing the geometry never loses it.
