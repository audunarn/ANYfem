"""The ANYstructure parity ledger, and the migration gate.

ANYfem is meant to replace ANYstructure's ``fem_integration.py`` eventually,
but only once it is complete and verified.  Deciding when that is would be a
matter of opinion unless someone writes down what "complete" means, so this
module writes it down.

The ledger is deliberately unflattering.  ``fem_integration`` exposes 176
options; the entries below are grouped by capability and marked against what
ANYfem actually does today.  A capability is ``covered`` only when ANYfem can
do the same job, ``partial`` when it can do some of it, and ``missing``
otherwise.  Marking something covered because it is nearly covered would
defeat the point of keeping a ledger at all.
