Impact is the one analysis where the two things users most often get wrong are
not the model but the *settings*: the contact penalty stiffness and the time
step.  Both have a defensible automatic value, so ANYfem computes them by
default and says what it used, rather than leaving a field at zero and
producing a plausible-looking answer from a badly conditioned contact.

    Three things set the step, and the smallest wins:

    * the **contact period** ``2 pi sqrt(m/k)``, resolved into
      ``steps_per_contact`` increments.  This is the one that matters most: a
      step near the contact period does not merely lose accuracy, the contact
      iteration fails to converge and the run reports a peak force that is
      nonsense;
    * the **travel per step**, so the sphere cannot pass through the structure
      between two steps;
    * the **wave transit time of the smallest element at the contact**,
      ``h / c``, when the caller supplies both.  This one binds only on a
      locally refined mesh, and it is why it exists: refining under the sphere
      raises the local frequencies without changing the contact period, so a
      step chosen from the contact period alone becomes too coarse for the mesh
      and the contact iteration diverges.  Bounding by transit time lets a
      refined mesh run at the penalty the solver recommended, instead of
      needing a softer contact -- which would change the answer rather than
      resolve it.

    The duration covers the approach plus ``post_contact_periods`` contact
    periods, which is the impact event and its immediate rebound.  Pass an
    explicit ``t_end`` to watch more of the structural response afterwards.

    ``skip_approach`` moves the sphere to just clear of the structure.  Free
    flight is exact -- constant velocity, no forces -- so integrating it costs
    steps and yields nothing.  The move is reported in ``notes`` rather than
    made silently.

    Refuses when the sphere would miss.  A sphere aimed past the structure
    otherwise runs to completion and reports a perfectly clean nothing.
